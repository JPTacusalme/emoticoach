That’s not just a bad day; it’s a pattern, and it’s pulling your overall grade down to around 45%. With the midterm in two weeks worth 30% of your final grade, we’re at a tipping point. I’m not trying to stress you out more, but if we don’t turn this around now, you’re looking at having to retake the whole course. I care about you, and I don’t want that to happen. So… how are you actually holding up?"
