I just finished grading those quizzes and... honestly, I'm a bit worried about you. \n\nI noticed you've been looking pretty stressed lately, and after seeing your scores on the last couple quizzes - the 35% on Data Structures and that 28% on Algorithms - I wanted to check in. \n\nLook, I'm not trying to freak you out, but with the midterm coming up in two weeks, I'm genuinely concerned about how you're doing. Both academically and, you know, just as a person. What's going on? Is everything okay?"

Your grades have taken a hit, especially with those two quizzes, and I know how much stress that can add. But here's the thing: I believe you can turn this around. You're not alone in this, and I'm here to help however I can.\n\nIs everything okay on a personal level? Sometimes life throws a lot at us, and it can be hard to keep up. If you're open to it, we could talk about a plan to get you back on trackâ€”maybe some extra tutoring or focusing on key areas before the midterm. Let me know how I can support you."
