I can hear the surprise (and maybe a little sting) in your “WHAT?” and I want to make sure we land this conversation somewhere useful instead of frustrating.\n\nWhen I said I’m not convinced the approach will work, I wasn’t rejecting you or your effort—I was flagging specific risks I see so we can fix them together. Think of it like a buddy tapping you on the shoulder before you step into the crosswalk: “Heads-up, traffic’s coming from the left.” Same intention here.\n\nCan you tell me which part felt like a punch? Once I know, I can rephrase the concerns so they feel constructive, not critical."
