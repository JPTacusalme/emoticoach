I care about you, and I don’t want to see you have to retake this class next semester. \n\nWhat’s been eating up your time lately? Is it work, family stuff, mental health, or are the concepts just not clicking? Let’s figure out a plan together—office hours, study group, lighter load next term—whatever it takes."

If that score stays in the 20s-30’s range, the math gets ugly fast.\n\nCan you carve out, like, an hour a day just for CS this week? Swing by my office hours tomorrow (3-5), or if that’s impossible, text me a time that works and I’ll shift stuff around. We’ll laser-focus on the stuff you missed on the quizzes—linked-lists, basic Big-O—so you’re not drowning in the whole textbook. You don’t have to ace it; you just need to pull a 60-ish on the midterm to stay alive. I’ve got review packets and past exams ready; let’s slam through them together."
