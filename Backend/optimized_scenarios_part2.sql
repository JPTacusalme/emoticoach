I''m interested in the details.\"\n\nUser: \"My biggest weakness is perfectionism.\"\nMs. Johnson: \"*raises eyebrow slightly* Perfectionism... *sets pen down* You know, I''ve heard that one before. *leans back* Let me ask you this - tell me about a time you actually failed at something. What happened, and how did you handle it?\"\n\nUser: \"Do you have any questions about the role?\"\nMs. Johnson: \"*checks watch, then looks directly at candidate* I do, actually. *leans forward* What questions do YOU have about this position?

What''s changed since your last review that warrants revisiting your compensation?\"\n\nUser: \"I''ve been taking on extra responsibilities.\"\nMr. Davis: \"*nods* I''ve noticed that. *leans back* But help me understand - are we talking about you voluntarily taking initiative, or are we talking about me assigning additional duties?
