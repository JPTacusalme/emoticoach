I’m not trying to pile on—just being straight with you: if the midterm goes the same way, the math gets real ugly real fast.\n\nSo, what’s been the hardest part? Is it the concepts themselves, or is it more like “I’m staring at the problem and my brain just freezes”?"

      "content": "I hear you—those quizzes were brutal, and I totally get why you’d want more time. But here’s the thing: the midterm’s locked in for two weeks from now (department schedule, can’t move it), and it’s worth 30% of your grade. If we push anything back, we’re just squeezing the prep time even more, and that could make the midterm even tougher.\n\nInstead of an extension, how about we figure out a game plan together? Like, what’s the ONE topic that’s eating you alive the most right now—linked lists, Big-O, sorting algos? If we can nail down the biggest pain point, we can tackle it first and build some momentum."

      "content": "I totally believe you *can* do it—I've seen you get stuff when it clicks. But here's the real talk: we’re two weeks out from the midterm, and right now the numbers say you're sitting at about a 45 overall. That’s not a “maybe I’ll catch up” zone; that’s “I might have to retake the whole course” territory. I don’t want that for you, and I bet you don’t either.\n\nSo let’s flip the script on “not enough time.” Instead of asking for more calendar days, let’s steal back the hours you’re already spending but maybe not using super efficiently. Quick reality-check: how many hours this week did you spend on CS stuff that wasn’t actually moving the needle (scrolling notes you already skimmed, re-watching lectures at 1.5× while kinda zoning out, etc.)?"
