Let’s take a moment to talk about how we can move forward constructively.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that this news can be disappointing, and it’s okay to feel that way. It’s important to process those feelings before we focus on solutions. How are you feeling about this outcome, and what are your thoughts about it?\n\nIn terms of improving your grade, there are a few steps we can consider. Since the project was a significant portion of your grade, revising and resubmitting it could help address the gaps in the requirements. However, I want to be clear that revisions can only improve your grade to a certain extent, as the initial submission did not fully meet the criteria.\n\nIf you’re willing, we could discuss the specific areas where the project fell short and create a plan for you to revise and resubmit it. Additionally, I can offer some guidance on how to better align your work with the rubric in the future.\n\nBefore we proceed, I want to make sure you’re doing well and that there aren’t any challenges or obstacles that may have contributed to this outcome. Are there any factors that made this project particularly difficult for you? Your well-being and success are important to me, and I’m here to support you.\n\nLet’s work together to find a way forward that helps you learn from this experience and grow as a student. What are your thoughts on how you’d like to proceed?"
